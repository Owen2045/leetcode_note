Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5 * 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
The input is generated such that a majority element will exist in the array.
 

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

## 1. 設定一個計數器c，以及一個主要元素main，遍歷陣列，如果c為0，則將當前元素設為main，如果當前元素不為main，則c-=1，如果當前元素為main，則c+=1 (摩爾投票法)
